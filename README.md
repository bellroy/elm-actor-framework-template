[Package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/tricycle/elm-actor-framework/latest).
Although it has no dependencies on it.

It supplies an uniform method of creating Templates for an Actor Model
environment.

## Templates

You can consider your Actors as reusable components and on its own it's a
powerful pattern. Since they can be so small and tangible they are easy to use
on templates perhaps enriching your formatting or adding functionality to them.
